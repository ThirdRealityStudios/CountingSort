# Counting Sort

Counting sort is a stable and non-comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Its Landau notation is: O(k+n)

**whereas**:

**n** is: the **amount of input elements**

**k** is: the **size of the "number interval" ยน** (see details on the implementation and comments)

Note! This implementation will fail if one of the input values is below 0 (zero).
Anyway, it is probably sufficient for most cases.

If you are German, you probably know TheSimpleClub
which is the place where I got this algorithm from in order to implement it (inclusive its first test scenario shown in the video):
